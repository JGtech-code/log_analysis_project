# Log Analysis & Detection with Python

This project demonstrates custom log analysis and anomaly detection using Python.
It simulates how a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst might detect suspicious activity (e.g., repeated failed logins, unusual IP addresses) by parsing raw log files and generating structured reports.

## Features
- Parse raw log files
- Detect suspicious or anomalous entries (e.g., unusual IPs, failed attempts)
- Save flagged entries into a separate suspicious log
- Generate a summary CSV report with statistics
- Modular design (`detection.py`, `report.py`, `main.py`) for easy extension

## Why This Project
This project was built to showcase practical cybersecurity and Python skills, focusing on:
- Log parsing & analysis
- Pattern recognition in security data
- Automation of reporting tasks

Itâ€™s designed as a foundational project for a SOC analyst workflow and can be extended to handle real-world datasets or integrate with SIEM tools.
